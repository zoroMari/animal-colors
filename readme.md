In this project I using: 
- TypeScript 
- SASS 
- HTML
<br> 

I also practise with such tools: 
- using export/import of different moduls of my project
- creating and using Classes (with privat and public variable and methods) 
- using types and interfaces for my variables
<br> 

During working with this project I implemented such features:  

:heavy_check_mark: create html elements dynamicaly in runtime by using js 

:heavy_check_mark: create logic for gallery with slides and thumbs

:heavy_check_mark: create Tabs with different types of information 

:heavy_check_mark: modify the URL without reloading the page, persist data via URL
